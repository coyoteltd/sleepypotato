SleepyPotato is a cordova app that dings once an hour, on the hour.  You can give it a sleep time and a wake time (so it doesn't ding at night).

I built it for my girlfriend, who wanted to have a simple app that would just ding (and didn't do anything else).  She'd downloaded all kinds of meditation timers, tried setting alarms and nothing just worked exactly the way she wanted it to.

SleepyPotato requires this fork of the background-mode plugin: https://office.commsult.de/bitbucket/projects/CORDOVA/repos/cordova-plugin-background-mode/browse?at=5e5e290b1ef. It will require you to turn off battery optimization (at least on the One Plus 6T and on most newer Samsung phones).  Those are the only device's I've tested it on.
