SleepyPotato is a cordova app that dings once an hour, on the hour.  I built it for my girlfriend, who wanted to have a simple app that would just ding (and didn't do anything else).  She'd downloaded all kinds of meditation timers, tried setting alarms and nothing just worked exactly the way she wanted it to.

SleepyPotato requires https://office.commsult.de/bitbucket/projects/CORDOVA/repos/cordova-plugin-background-mode/browse?at=5e5e290b1ef plugin, and will require you to turn off battery optimization (at least on the One Plus 6T and on most newer Samsung phones).  That's the only place I've tested it.
